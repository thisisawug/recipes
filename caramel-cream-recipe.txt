Ingredients:
 - 100grams granulated sugar
 - 100ml heavy cream
 - 50ml water
 - (optional) a pinch of salt
 - (optional) 1 tablespoon of dark rum

Directions:
 1. Place the sugar and water in a saucepan set over medium heat. DO NOT stir
    with a spatula. Shake the saucepan gently to heat sugar and water uniformly
    until the sugar melts completely and turns a dark brown color. Stop heating.
    (The darker the color is, more bitter the caramel cream is. It's up to you
    when you stop.)

 2. Slowly pour in the heavy cream, stir continuously until the cream combined.
    Be careful the cream and hot melted sugar can splash.

 3. Add a pinch of salt or 1 tablespoon of dark rum to taste.
